## 6.2 Star Rating System

### 6.2.1 5-Star Rating Display for Credibility

- **Purpose**:

  - To visually display customer satisfaction and build credibility through a
    **5-star rating system**.

- **Design**:

  - Each review will include a **star rating** next to the customer’s name, with
    5 stars representing the highest level of satisfaction.
  - Use **gold stars** for filled ratings, and **gray stars** to represent any
    missing stars (e.g., a 4-star review would display 4 gold stars and 1 gray
    star).

- **Aggregate Rating**:

  - Optionally, display an **aggregate rating** at the top of the testimonials
    section, calculated from all posted reviews (e.g., _"4.8 out of 5 stars
    based on 50 reviews"_).
  - This would appear as a larger rating at the top of the section with a brief
    description below, like _"See what our happy customers are saying."_.

- **Functionality**:

  - **Clickable stars**: When users click on the stars, they are taken to a
    **dedicated reviews page** where they can read more detailed reviews or
    submit their own.

- **Mobile Responsiveness**:
  - On smaller screens, make sure the star ratings and review text are
    **centered** and stack neatly below the customer’s name for easy reading.
